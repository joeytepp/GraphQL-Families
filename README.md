This is an example implementation for storing information about families and their relationships. This was created with Node, Express and MongoDB and shows the querying power of GraphQL.

Port is set to 5000 and MongoDB to your local database by default, but these can be configured with a `.env` file containing the keys `MONGO_URI` and `PORT` at the root of the project folder
